            <div><h2>No Poll Says That: Biden Digs In as Democratic Fears Deepen</h2>
                <p>
                    Days after President Biden said only the “Lord Almighty” could drive him from the race, he laid out a far more earthly scenario at his closely watched news conference on Thursday night: His advisers would have to prove to him that he was headed for certain defeat.

But leaning into the microphone and whispering to dramatize his defiance, Mr. Biden made clear that he did not foresee this happening.

“No one’s saying that,” he said. “No poll says that.”

He seemed to open the door to an alternative, then swiftly shut it. Sure, “other people can beat Trump,” he said, but it would be too hard to “start from scratch.”

The president’s first news conference since the debate amounted to a competent presentation, if not a compelling performance. But it remained in doubt whether it was enough to stop the bleeding of Democratic support that has threatened to hemorrhage. Minutes after he left the stage, the drip-drip-drip of Democratic members of Congress calling for him to step aside continued unabated.

            <h2>Five Takeaways From Bidens News Conference</h2>
            <p>In a nearly hourlong news conference, the president defended his decision to stay in the race amid questions about his age and mental acuity, but also showed a command of foreign policy.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>President Biden on Thursday answered questions from reporters about foreign policy, whether he is up to defeating former President Donald J. Trump and why he is resisting calls from Democrats to end his candidacy, as he sought to recover from a crisis of confidence that has engulfed his campaign.

                With a growing number of Democratic lawmakers, donors and elected officials urging Mr. Biden to drop out of the race after a disastrous debate performance last month, the closing news conference of a NATO summit in Washington became a high-stakes chance for the president to quiet concerns about his candidacy. The results were mixed.
                
                Mr. Biden stumbled early but remained defiant in the face of questions about his fitness to continue his campaign. He struggled to articulate a cohesive case for his candidacy, even as he gave a forceful defense of his record and showed a strong command over foreign policy.</p>

            <h2>NHRC issues notice over rescue of 23 child labourers in Saraswati Vihar.
            </h2>
            <p>New Delhi, Jul 9 (PTI) The NHRC said on Tuesday that it issued a notice to the Delhi government and the city's police commissioner over reports of 23 child labourers being rescued from the Northwest district.
                They were reportedly brought from nearby states and allegedly worked in various factories, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) said in a statement.
                A survey of Delhi is required to know if there are more industrial units where children are being engaged as labourers and what action has been taken against them, it said.
                The rights body took suo motu cognisance of a media report from July 5 that said 23 child labourers, including nine girls, were rescued from the Saraswati Vihar area.
                It observed that the content of the report, if true, raised a serious issue of violation of the rights of the children.
                The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act prohibits the employment of children under the age of 14 in any capacity. The law also makes it a criminal offence to employ a child.
                Accordingly, the NHRC issued notices to the Delhi chief secretary and the police commissioner to submit a detailed report within two weeks.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The Northwest Delhi district magistrate has been directed to submit a report indicating the action taken, according to provisions of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, steps taken for their rehabilitation and reunion with their respective families as well as to continue their education, the commission said.
                The district magistrate is also expected to inform regarding legal action taken if any child labourer was being kept "under bondage", it added.
                Earlier, the commission came across such complaints or news reports that alleged violations of labour laws by owners of some factories running in the national capital. In view of this, the commission also sought to know about the action taken against such delinquent employers, the statement said.
                In a separate statement, the NHRC said it took suo motu cognisance of a media report from July 5, alleging that the infrastructure of a civil hospital in Jind in Haryana was in "poor condition".
                "There are 55 sanctioned posts of doctors in the hospital out of which only 19 posts are filled. Reportedly, about 2,000 patients visit the hospital daily. However, most of them are referred to other hospitals as it has neither proper medical equipment nor medicines. The monkey menace in the hospital has further added to their woes," the statement said.
                The commission observed the content of the news report, if true, raised a serious issue of violation of the right to health and medical care of the patients.
                Accordingly, it issued a notice to the Haryana chief secretary, seeking a detailed report within one week.
                The report is expected to include the steps taken or proposed to be taken to improve the overall condition of the Jind Civil Hospital so that patients can get medical care without any difficulty and are not referred to the other hospitals due to the non-availability of doctors and other necessary life-saving facilities, it said.

            <h2>Reduce tariffs on manufacturing inputs for electronics: ICEA
            </h2><p>The Indian Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), which represents domestic electronics manufacturers, called on Tuesday for a reduction of import duties as a key Union budget demand. “With a sustained increase in production with the help of supportive policies, including the PLI, India now has entered a phase when the growth of the mobile phone sector depends not on domestic demand but on demand in the global market,” 
                the ICEA said in a report prepared for the Finance Ministry.Pankaj Mohindroo, the ICEA’s President, argued against the relatively high tariffs India imposes on manufacturing inputs — China and Vietnam’s tariffs apply on fewer components and are of lower rates — saying that domestic component makers were increasing prices to just below the net prices of inputs to take advantage of the situation. “Global suppliers also consider the higher domestic price as their reference price in their negotiations with exporters because their imported inputs are duty-free for exports,” the ICEA report said.
    
                These tariffs, Mr. Mohindroo said, were compounded by customs authorities hindering orderly shipments of key components, likening the situation to an imported shirt being held back on account of higher duties on buttons. 
                
               
                
                </p></div>
        <div><p> Since much of the fresh production of phones in India is being exported, Mr. Mohindroo said, duties should be slashed to promote competitiveness of Indian assembly and manufacturing operations with the main other leaders in the sector, China and Vietnam. “Current high tariffs increase manufacturing costs in India by 7–7.5% on the bill of materials,” Mr. Mohindroo said. </p></div>

        <div><h2>Farmers seek hike in production incentive for paddy</h2><p>Farmers’ organisations have pointed out that they have not reaped the full benefits of the MSP increases over the past four years. Each time the Central government raised the MSP, the State government reduced its own contribution.
    
            Sonichan Pulinkunnu, general secretary of the Paddy Farmers’ Protection Council in Kuttanad, says the previous Left Democratic Front government had promised a State production incentive of ₹9.52 per kg. Instead, over the past four years, this amount has been reduced to ₹6.37 per kg.
            
            Moreover, farmers are concerned about the stagnation of handling charges for paddy. These charges are intended to cover the costs associated with transporting paddy from fields and processing it into rice at Supplyco outlets.
            As the State government works to speed up the distribution of dues to paddy farmers in Kuttanad, the calls to raise State production incentives to match the new minimum support price (MSP) are now gaining momentum.
    
    
            At present, paddy farmers receive ₹28.12 per kg, which includes 12 paise for handling charges. Of this, ₹21.83 is the MSP set by the Centre. With the recent increase of ₹1.17 by the Central government, farmers should be entitled to ₹29.29 per kg, inclusive of handling charges.
            
        </p></div> <div><p>However, this increment is contingent upon the State government maintaining its current contribution of ₹6.37, plus the 12 paise handling charge.

            In 2005-06, the handling charge was ₹45 per quintal, with farmers receiving ₹12 per quintal to help cover expenses. “Despite the Central government recently increasing these charges to ₹272 per quintal, the State government has not updated its contribution from the rate set 19 years ago,” says Mr. Pulinkunnu

            Unscripted and Unbowed, Biden Seeks to Overcome Missteps With Policy Talk
            </h2><p> Did President Biden really think that Donald J. Trump was his vice president instead of Kamala Harris? Of course not. Did he actually believe that he was meeting with Vladimir V. Putin instead of Volodymyr Zelensky? Not at all.

                But when it comes to his political future, did it matter that he mixed up those names in front of television cameras on Thursday? Well, it certainly did not help.
                
                For nearly an hour, at the most anticipated news conference of his presidency, Mr. Biden held forth on the nation, the world and his future. He demonstrated a grasp of the issues and seemed most comfortable during a long discourse on foreign policy. He argued that age gave him wisdom and made clear that he had no intention of dropping out of the race.
                
                The challenge, however, is that every momentary flub, every verbal miscue, even if quickly corrected, now takes on outsize importance, ricocheting across the internet in viral video clips, some more distorted than others, that may reinforce doubts about his capacity. He gets no free passes anymore, not since last month’s debate. The reality is that every public appearance between now and November will be scrutinized for evidence of infirmity.</p></div>

        <div><h2>Rescued Hostage Describes Months of Uncertainty and Terror in Gaza
        </h2><p>Idling away the hours in a darkened room in Gaza with two other hostages, Andrey Kozlov sometimes heard one of his captors on the other side of the door typing away on a laptop.

            The man was a constant presence in the apartment, while other guards worked shifts and went out to the market, Mr. Kozlov said in an interview, from a hotel room in a Tel Aviv suburb a month after his rescue from captivity.
            
            The guards were unmasked, but they were careful not to reveal their names, telling the hostages to call them all Muhammad.
            
            To differentiate between them, Mr. Kozlov said the hostages gave them nicknames like Big Muhammad and Little Muhammad. Their main jailer had a rounded face, so they called him “Muhammad H’dudim,” Hebrew slang for “Muhammad Chubby Cheeks.”

        <div><h2>Why Nursing Home Residents Still Suffer Despite Tough State Laws</h2><p>For hours, John A. Pernorio repeatedly mashed the call button at his bedside in the Heritage Hills nursing home in Rhode Island. A retired truck driver, he had injured his spine in a fall on the job decades earlier and could no longer walk. The antibiotics he was taking made him need to go to the bathroom frequently. But he could only get there if someone helped him into his wheelchair.

            By the time an aide finally responded, he’d been lying in soiled briefs for hours, he said. It happened time and again.
            
            “It was degrading,” said Mr. Pernorio, 79. “I spent 21 hours a day in bed.”
            
            Payroll records show that during his stay at Heritage Hills, daily aide staffing levels were 25 percent below the minimums under state law. The nursing home said it provided high-quality care to all residents. Regardless, it wasn’t in trouble with the state, because Rhode Island does not enforce its staffing rule.</p></div>

        <div><h2>Martyr Inc.: How Trump Monetized a Persecution Narrative</h2><p>Former President Donald J. Trump hawks $59.99 Bibles with the same words he uses to win the votes of evangelical Christians. He sells swatches of the suit he wore in a mug shot while also raising money for his campaign by calling himself a “political prisoner.” He describes Truth Social, his refuge for those banned on other social media sites — and his best chance to substantially increase his wealth — as a bulwark against liberal companies out to silence Christians and conservatives.

            As he seeks to reclaim the presidency, Mr. Trump has reprised the pitchman role from his reality TV days, with a crucial difference: He has intertwined the marketing of his private business affairs with the messaging of his campaign, leveraging his political stature for profit.
            
            All of it could be described as Martyr Inc., a machinery that makes Mr. Trump money and promotes his re-election by characterizing him as unjustly persecuted and selflessly saving his supporters from a similar fate.
            
            His most loyal followers have gone along for the ride, forming a niche marketplace for products bearing the Trump name and vowing to help prop up the stock price for the company that owns Truth Social. Even after recent declines, Mr. Trump’s shares are worth more than $3 billion, though he cannot yet sell.</p></div>

        <div><h2>Heat-Related Emergencies Are Soaring in the U.S. Can Hospitals Keep Up?</h2><p>
            On a recent Friday in Albuquerque, as triple-digit temperatures stretched into the evening, a 69-year-old man collapsed in his home. His body temperature hit 107.7 degrees by the time emergency responders whisked him to the University of New Mexico Hospital.

Nurses and emergency physicians began a process that has become familiar, preparing a device the size of a mini-fridge that rapidly cools and regulates body temperature by funneling cold fluids to pads that cover a patient’s abdomen and thighs. Workers dumped ice on his body as part of a last-ditch effort to curtail his heatstroke.

It was too late. The man’s blood pressure had plummeted, and he suffered a heart attack. Less than 24 hours later, he was dead.

Extreme heat, intensified by climate change, has blanketed much of the United States this summer, killing more than a dozen people in Oregon in recent days. Large parts of California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah have been under excessive heat warnings, which local officials believe contributed to more than 90 deaths in the West this month.
